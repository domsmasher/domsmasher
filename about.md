Matteo Gildone is a front-end developer living and working in London, UK.
In a previous life, Matteo was an auto mechanic who woke up one day and realized
that working from the neck down sucked. The tools were sold and a computer was purchased.
The first project was a tire-sales website for a tire distribution company
he was working for. It was a truly horrible website (but hey, the clock still works!).
But committed to honing the craft; he pressed on.
A few freelance jobs later and he had landed a full-time gig as a Jr. Web Developer
with a lip balm manufacturing company.

As the skillset and passion grew, the right opportunity came along in the form
of a contract with Time Warner Cable - this parlayed into a managers role and
building a team of some of the finest coders this side of the Mississippi.

Today, working as a self-employed freelancer, Max is developing the front-ends
primarily for GLG and knocking out a few side projects along the way.
Have a look around the site and if you have feedback, don't be shy.

### How I work
 - MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch) - running Yosemite beta v1.0
 - Atom is my editor of choice
 - Chrome: I tend to develop almost exclusively in Chrome at the start of projects.
At one point I developed in Firefox exclusively. These days though, I typically
do mile-marker checkins in Firefox, Safari, Opera, and
Internet Explorer (back to IE8, let's not dwell on that fact).
 - Terminal

About this site
 - Built on Jekyll, the open source static site generator
 - Hosted on Github Pages
 - The HTML is written in vanilla HTML, but I'm redoing it in HAML, because HAML is the bees knees!
 - The CSS is written in Sass
 - Then things get grunted, but I'm starting to lean towards gulp. Time will tell.
 - Posts are written in markdown

This site was previously just an online resume holder, but I've decided that
I have things to say and share so this seemed like the most logical place.
I have also published my style guide and pattern library which are pet projects
that I love to tweak and improve occassionaly; typically after I learn a new shiny thing.
